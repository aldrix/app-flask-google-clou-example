# DESCRIPCION: Configure the settings of your App Engine application

#              This file specifies your Python application's runtime configuration
#              including URL routing, versions, static file uploads, etc. See
#              https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/appconfig
#              for details.

runtime: python27
api_version: 1
threadsafe: yes

# Handlers define how to route requests to your application. When App Engine 
# receives a request for a URL beginning with /static, it maps the
# remainder of the path to files in the static directory, and if an 
# appropriate file is found, the contents of the file are returned to 
# the client.
handlers:
- url: /static
  static_dir: static
- url: .* # This regex directs all routes to main.app
  script: main.app

# Third party libraries that are included in the App Engine SDK must be listed
# here if you want to use them.  See
# https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/libraries27 for
# a list of libraries included in the SDK.  Third party libs that are *not* part
# of the App Engine SDK don't need to be listed here, instead add them to your
# project directory, either as a git submodule or as a plain subdirectory.
# TODO: List any other App Engine SDK libs you may need here.
